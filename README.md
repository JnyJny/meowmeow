### Introduction

It has often been said that the art of computer programming is part
managing complexity and part naming things. I contend that this is
largely true with the addition of "and sometimes it requires drawing
boxes".

In this article I'll name some things and manage some complexity while
writing a small C program that is loosely based on the structure I
introduced discussing [another C program][1], but different in that it
will do something. Grab your favorite beverage, your favorite editor
and compiler and let's write a mildly interesting C program together.
